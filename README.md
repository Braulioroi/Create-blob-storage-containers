First we create a storage account fill in the basic data (subscription, resource group name, resource name, region) and deploy the storage

Once the resource is created, we go to the containers section and we create a new container, we give the new container a name and we give public access level

Once the instance is created, we load any file that we have, we select the file that we load to the store and it will show us the link to access our page
